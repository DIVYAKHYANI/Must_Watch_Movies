          <h2>Casablanca (1942)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(casablanca.jpg)"></div>
          <p>Set in the early years of World War II in Casablanca, Rick Blaine's (Humphrey Bogart)
            nightclub is an oasis for refugees despite the warnings he gets from local authorities.

            One of the most famous old Hollywood films of all time, Casablanca is a love story you won't forget.

          <h2>Farewell (2019)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(farewell.jpg)"></div>
          <p>In her Golden Globe-winning role, Awkwafina plays Billi, a woman on a trip to China for a "family wedding"
            that's actually a final goodbye to her grandmother. While there,
            Billi struggles to find a deeper connection to the country and
            tries to understand her family's decision to keep her grandmother's sickness a secret from her.

          <h2>Rebel Without a cause (1955)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(rebel.jfif)"></div>
          <p>Two words for you: James! Dean!
            The old Hollywood icon's second to last film, as teenager Jim Stark,
            before his untimely death in 1955 ended up being one of his most celebrated.
            The unlikely bond shared on-screen between him, John "Plato" Crawford (Sal Mineo),
            and Judy (Natalie Wood) gave American youths at the time a movie where they could finally see themselves on the screen....

          <h2>Life is Beautiful (1997)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(life.jpg)"></div>
          <p>While this Italian film is about the horrors of the Holocaust,
            it has plenty of comic moments as well—and it works. Roberto Benigni gives a breathtaking performance as a family man who,
            as a Jew, is sent with his family to a concentration camp in northern Italy,
            but uses his imaginative powers to convince his young son that it's all a game....

          <h2>Jurassic Park (1993)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(jurasic.jpg)"></div>
          <p>It's a little hard to believe that the Schindler's List director also came up with this dino adventure movie,
            but what's even more impressive is that the two films came out mere months apart.
            This could not be more different, but if you're looking for a film about these prehistoric creatures,
             stick to the classic.There's so much loving attention paid to the dinosaurs' look—there isn't a ton of CGI,
              with a greater reliance on practical effects—but more importantly,
            the human characters are just as interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, in the best cameo of all time. ...

          <h2>The Dark Knight (2008)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(dark.jpg)"></div>
          <p>This second movie in the Batman trilogy is arguably the best of the bunch.
            Heath Ledger sets the standard what it takes to play the Joker,
            as he won an Oscar for his performance. Some say it's the best superhero film ever made and we have to agree....

          <h2>Forrest Gump (1994)</h2>
          <div class="article-image" style="background:url(forrest.jpg)"></div>
          <p>You've probably seen it a dozen times, but it's worth it every time.
            Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life (don't fight me on this) as Forrest Gump,
            an intellectually challenged man from Alabama who lives an extraordinary life....
